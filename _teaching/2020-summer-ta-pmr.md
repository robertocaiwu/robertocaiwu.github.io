Course Description
======
In this course we introduce concepts such as Bayesian Networks to model uncertainty and knowledge of the world in a natural, efficient, and systematic way.

Content
======
* Handling Uncertainty
* Probabilistic Reasoning
* Probabilistic Reasoning over Time
* Learning Bayesian Networks
* Making Simple Decisions
* Making Complex Decisions

Goals
======
* Professional competency:
  * The students know probabilistic models like Bayesian Networks, Gaussian and other probability distributions to describe uncertain processes.
* Methodological competency:
  * Ability to apply probabilistic methods like Kalman Filters or Particle Filters to data processing, modeling and reasoning tasks.
* Individual competency:
  * Sensibility for strength and limits of the significance and validity of probabilistic descriptions and probability based arguments.
